        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Coquito, a traditional Puerto Rican beverage, is a rich and creamy concoction that embodies the warmth 
            and festive spirit of the Christmas season. Its name, "coquito," translates to "little coconut" in 
            Spanish, aptly capturing its essence as a coconut-based delight. This tropical treasure is a
            cherished part of Puerto Rican culture, gracing tables during family gatherings and parrandas
            (traditional Christmas caroling festivities).
