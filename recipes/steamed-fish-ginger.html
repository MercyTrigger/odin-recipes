        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            In the realm of culinary artistry, steamed fish with ginger stands as a testament to simplicity at 
            its finest. This elegant dish showcases the delicate flavors of fresh seafood while harmoniously 
            blending them with the aromatic warmth of ginger, creating a symphony of flavors that tantalize the
            taste buds.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key to this culinary masterpiece lies in the delicate balance of flavors. The ginger, with its
            subtle spiciness and earthy undertone, delicately enhances the natural sweetness of the fish, 
            while the soy sauce adds a savory depth and umami richness. The scallions, with their crisp texture
            and vibrant green hue, provide a refreshing counterpoint to the ginger's warmth, while the sesame
            oil lends a nutty finish that ties the flavors together.

            <li>3 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon light soy sauce</li>

        </ul>  
        <h2>Steps</h2>

                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>
                    Pat halibut dry with paper towels. Rub both sides of fillet with salt. 
                    Scatter the ginger over the top of the fish and place onto a heatproof ceramic dish.

            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>
                    Place into a bamboo steamer set over several inches of gently boiling water, 
                    and cover. Gently steam for 10 to 12 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>
                    Pour accumulated water out of the dish and sprinkle the fillet with green onion. 
                    Drizzle both soy sauces over the surface of the fish.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Step</h3>
                <p>
                    Heat peanut and sesame oils in a small skillet over medium-high heat until they 
                    begin to smoke. When the oil is hot, carefully pour on top of the halibut fillet. 
                    The very hot oil will cause the green onions and water on top of the fish to pop 
                    and spatter all over; be careful. Garnish with cilantro sprigs and serve immediately.
