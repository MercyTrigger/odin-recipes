        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These bacon-wrapped dates are stuffed with creamy goat cheese for the perfect salty-sweet appetizer bite.
            Deglet Noor dates are smaller than Medjool dates and work best for this recipe. Center-cut bacon has
            had fat removed from either side of the strip, making it a leaner choice. If you're having trouble
            keeping the bacon in place, secure it with a wooden pick before baking.
        </p>
