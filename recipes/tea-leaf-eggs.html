        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Tea eggs are one of my favorite dishes and traditional lucky food to make for the Lunar New Year.
            These hard-boiled eggs are subtly flavored with anise and have a deep brown hue from black tea 
            and soy. The marbled patterns from the cracked shells make these quite attractive.
            I eat them chilled and sliced in quarters as a side dish, appetizer, or snack.
